# Project Description


  Popular video-sharing platforms, such as TikTok and YouTube, extract large portions of value from creators and viewers. Most of the advertising revenue is kept by the centralized company for servers, employees, investments, and profit. A decentralized competitor could alter these categories in ways that allow for a significantly larger portion of revenue to go to users.
	Centralized data storage servers can be replaced with IPFS, and Filecoin can augment this storage by ensuring that videos can persist indefinitely. Centralized computational servers can be replaced with local computation and with smart contract blockchains, such as Cardano, in which computation is decentralized and automatic. Costs associated with employees are unnecessary, as the platform can be managed and developed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Additionally, unless the DAO decides otherwise, most investments are unnecessary (as scaling to user growth can happen automatically). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of profit extraction does not exist in this model.
	All of these (previously necessary) costs can instead be funneled into users’ wallets, which would attract new viewers and creators and incentivize the creation of better content. To implement these decentralized and financial concepts, we propose an application that takes advantage of decentralized data storage (through IPFS and Filecoin) and decentralized computation to allow users to upload their own videos and stream others’ videos.



Please describe exactly what you are planning to build. Make sure to include the following:
- Start with the need or problem you are trying to solve with this project.
- Describe why your solution is going to adequately solve this problem.

This section should be 2-3 paragraphs long.

## Value

  This proposal would benefit the Filecoin ecosystem by drastically increasing the demand for storage on the Filecoin network. The Filecoin network, as claimed by https://file.app/, has about 24 Petabytes of actual data storage, or about 0.25% of the available storage on the network (9.285 Exabytes as claimed by https://filfox.info/en). A drive for demand of data storage on the network would dramatically improve the state and reputation of the overall ecosystem. For example, although clearly an upper bound, 500 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute. At a conservative 1GB per hour of video, that's 250PiB each year. If BitBlock achieved even 1% of that amount, that would increase the useful storage on Filecoin by over 10% in a single year.
  If not successful, the risks to the Filecoin ecosystem are nonexistant. 

Please describe in more detail why this proposal is valuable for the Filecoin ecosystem. Answer the following questions:
- What are the benefits to getting this right?
- What are the risks if you don't get it right?
- What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

This section should be 1-3 paragraphs long.

## Deliverables

Please describe in details what your final deliverable for this project will be. Include a specification of the project and what functionality the software will deliver when it is finished.

## Development Roadmap

Please break up your development work into a clear set of milestones. This section needs to be very detailed (will vary on the project, but aim for around 2 pages for this section).

For each milestone, please describe:
- The software functionality that we can expect after the completion of each milestone. This should be detailed enough that it can be used to ensure that the software meets the specification you outlined in the Deliverables.
- How many people will be working on each milestone and their roles
- The amount of funding required for each milestone
- How much time this milestone will take to achieve (using real dates)

## Total Budget Requested

Sum up the total requested budget across all milestones, and include that figure here. Also, please include a budget breakdown to specify how you are planning to spend these funds.

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Specify your team's long-term plans to maintain this software and upgrade it over time.
